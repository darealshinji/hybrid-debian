version 2.1.8(b)
- Fixed join files problem with True-HD track
- introduce MAC build


version 2.1.6(b)
- Add support for combined AVC+MVC streams
- Output file size slightly reduced
- Fixed bug if mux AVC+MVC tracks to m2ts file. Some 3d m2ts movies did not play on Samsung Smart TV
- Fixed minor bug in a SSIF interleaving for some movies
- introduce Linux build


version 2.1.4(b)

version 2.1.2(b);
- fixed bug in MVC stream recognition. MVC from Intel Media Encoder now work.
- SSIF files is not required any more if you open 3D MPLS file
- Add Stereo subtitles basic support. If source PG stream has stereo format, same stereo PG stream will be created in a output file
- Add tag <force> (or <f>) to srt parser. This tag force to show subtitle message. For instance:

	1
	00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:20,375
	<force>
	<b>Senator</b>, we're making
	our final approach into Coruscant.

version 1.12.10(b):
- fixed H.264 stream parser. Same fix as in previous version but more careful
- fixed subtitles color selection in UI


version 1.12.10(b):

version 1.12.9(b):
- fixed file join for mov/mp4
- fixed bug in SEI unit processing (if enable options 'insert picture timing'). Bug may cause video distortion.

- several more minor fixes in transport stream to improve Blu-ray compatibility
- fixed E-AC3 codec


version 1.12.3(a):
- fixed problem with ssif muxing
- add addition check for 'insert picture timing' parameter. For MVC depended view used same value as for primary video stream

This parameter filled automatically in GUI if open MPLS file.

version 1.12.2(a):
- add 3d bluray support. Bluray muxing activated automatically if MVC substream appears in input tracks.
To reduce HDD space, tsMuxeR doesn't produce ssif file, only a couple of .m2ts files. ssif files can be
